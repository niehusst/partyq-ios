# partyq iOS

> PROJECT CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT

partyq is a music queue app that uses Spotify to play music. If one person has Spotify premium (and the Spotify app on their device) they can use partyq to host a music party for a group of people with partyq who don't have Spotify (and are nearby/connected to the same wifi). Everyone connected to the party can search for and add songs to a shared queue, while the host device plays the music using Spotify.
    
Note that many of the Spotify API and AppRemote endpoints that this app depends on are in beta and are subject to change without warning.

## Contributing

This is an open-source project, so contributions are welcome! 

This project was built using Xcode 13.2.1 + associated tools. Compatibility with future versions of Xcode is not guaranteed.

To get started, all you need to do (once you've got Xcode dev tools all setup) is run the `setup.sh` script; it will install all the necessary dependencies and add some git hooks to run linting (they only run in this repo).
